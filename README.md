### What is this repository for? ###

A simple web app which intends to allow users to create and view ToDos. It is "incomplete" and contains some partially completed cucumber tests. Therefore it can be a good "play project" to practice writing up and designing an app using cucumber.

### How do I get set up? ###

* Clone repository
* Do mvn clean install
* Do mvn spring-boot:run
* Go http://localhost:8080/health: If all successful, the status should be "UP".
